# Hekate Toolbox

A Swiss Army Knife for Hekate. It was originally developed for the use with AnnsAnn's SDFiles (Later AtlasNX's Kosmos), but fully works with Hekate-based CFW configurations and some features even work without it.

## Current Features
- Reading and modifying of the hbmenu launch button combination 
- Actually modifying the hbmenu config as well so settings stick across reboots
- Reading and modifying from where hbmenu launches by default
- Sysmodule hotloading and unloading
- Reboot to Hekate profiles and the Hekate menu
- Boot to UMS (SD Card)
- Mariko support (Limits features)

## Compiling

You need: 

```
 switch-libjpeg-turbo
 switch-freetype
 switch-dev
```
